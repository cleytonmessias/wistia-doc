Domain restrictions apply to all videos in your account. Here's how to set up
Domain restrictions for your account:

1. Open to the Account tab in your Account Settings (which requires
  account owner privileges).
2. Select the "Enabled" radio button, and enter the domains you wish to whitelist.
  Don't forget to save your updates!
3. When you embed your videos onto a website you allow, it will appear
  properly. If the video was embedded on a webpage **not** in your whitelist,
  it would appear as it does below.
