## Owner-Level Permissions

The Owner of the Wistia Account has the highest permissions of any user.  There is only one Owner-level Contact on each Account, which can be set from the "Account" tab of the Account Settings.

Owners have access to anything a manager or contact does, but in addition, they can:

*  Check the Stats of Any Project
*  Monitor the Usage of the Account (bandwidth & storage)
*  Add new Managers to the Account
*  Change the Logo, Name, or URL on the Account
*  Cancel the Wistia Account

## Manager-Level Permissions

"Managers" in Wistia are the controllers of the content in accounts. Managers can do things like add Projects, upload medias, and share those Projects/videos with new viewers.  They can also control contacts, create new groups, and send messages out to those contacts.

Managers can:

*  Create and manage projects
*  Create new viewers and manage their permissions
*  Upload video and other media content
*  Invite viewers to privately view video
*  View tracking statistics for private video sharing
*  Publish videos to third party websites (also called "embedding a video")
*  View embedded video statistics
*  Receive email alerts for account activity

## Contact-Level Permissions

"Contacts" must be created by the Account owners or Managers.  The access that contacts have can be limited to viewing a specific Project, and the videos contained therein.  When a contact is created, their access can also include things like the ability to upload new content, download content, and share content.  Contacts are required to create a password to access the system.
